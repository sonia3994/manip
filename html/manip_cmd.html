<P><B><FONT SIZE="+2">Manipulator Commands</FONT></B>

<P>This is an explanation of all the commands available through the manipulator
control software. Some commands have required parameters indicated by angle
braces &lt;>, and others have optional parameters indicated by square braces
[].

<P>Commands are not case sensitive, and are indicated here in uppercase
for convention only.

<P>Commands may be separated by semicolons, allowing you to enter more
than one command on a line. This can be useful if you want to perform a
number of tasks simultaneously, such as starting a group of motors at the
same time.

<P>Not all commands are available at all times. For instance, while an
object is busy only a limited set of commands are accessible.  Also, some
commands are accessible only while in expert mode (use the EXPERT command
to enter or leave expert mode).

<P><A NAME="CmdFile"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Command
Files</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Command files are ASCII files that contain a list of commands (one per
line) to be executed in order. Command file names end in .CMD. If an unrecognized
command is entered, the manipulator program appends a .CMD to the command
entered, and attempts to run a command file by that name. For example,
entering "TESTING ONE TWO THREE" will attempt to read commands from the
file TESTING.CMD with parameters ONE, TWO and THREE. Parameters entered
on the command line are subsituted for strings %1, %2, %3 ... %9 in the
file.

<P>Commands are executed sequentially from the file as soon as the target
object is accessible. Care must be taken to avoid unexpected results such
as with the command sequence:
<UL><B>LASERBALL TO 0 0 0</B>
<BR><B>WAIT 120</B>
<BR><B>LASERBALL TO -500 0 0</B></UL>
The wait command will begin execution as soon as the laserball has started
moving to 0 0 0, so the second move command will be executed 120 seconds
after the motion started to the first point provided the laserball is ready
to accept the next movement command. If the intent was for the source to
remain stationary for 120 seconds, then this is the correct command sequence:
<UL><B>LASERBALL TO 0 0 0</B>
<BR><B>LASERBALL WAIT</B>
<BR><B>WAIT 120</B>
<BR><B>LASERBALL TO -500 0 0</B></UL>
The LASERBALL WAIT command halts processing of the command file until the
LASERBALL object is ready for another command (i.e. the motion has stopped).

<P>The STOP command halts processing of the current command file. Note
that command file execution continues even after an error occurs in one
of the executed commands.

<P>It is possible to execute a command file from within another command file,
however when the second command file ends, execution of the first command
file does not resume.  

<P>When the MANIP program starts, it automatically tries to execute a command
called AUTOEXEC.&nbsp; This has the effect of executing all commands in
the AUTOEXEC.CMD file (if it exists) each time MANIP is run.

<P><A NAME="PolyAxis"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>PolyAxis
Commands</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The PolyAxis object is the primary object used for controlling the position
of the source. The most common of these commands are LOCATE, which must
be done each time a source is inserted, and TO, which is used each time
the source is moved to a new location.
<TABLE BORDER=2 CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2 >
<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>TO &lt;x y z></B></TD>

<TD>The fundamental command used to move the manipulator to a specific
position. The destination position must be given, and is specified by its
x, y and z coordinates separated by spaces. If the desitination is illegal
(outside the vessel, or outside the allowed tension region) an error message
will be displayed, and the source will not be moved. The source may not
move to the exact coordinates you specify due to physical constraints.
For example, a source constrained to move in the x-z plane at y=0 will
move to location (x 0 z) regardless of the y coordinate entered in the
command. (i.e. PROTOTYPE TO 100.0 0 123.4)</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>BY &lt;dx dy dz></B></TD>

<TD>Moves the source relative to its current position. The displacement
in x, y and z is specified in the command. (i.e. PROTOTYPE BY 0 0 10 --
moves the prototype source up 10 cm)</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>STOP</B></TD>

<TD>Stops the motion of the source by gracefully ramping down the motor
speeds of all axes connected to the source. This command also effects motors
not contained by axes, such as the aiming motors of a rotating source.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>HALT</B></TD>

<TD>Immediately stops the motion of the source by abruptly halting the
motors of all axes. Used for emergencies only. For normal circumstances,
use the STOP command instead.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>LOCATE &lt;x y z></B></TD>

<TD>Calibrate the initial position of the source. This command forces recalculation
of all rope lengths, and resets all axis errors to zero. The position specified
in the command is the current source position. This command must be issued
for a known position in the glove box before a new source is lowered into
the detector.  If an umbilical is connected, this command performs an umbilical
"init" which assumes there is no physical slack in the umbilical.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>TENSIONFIND</B></TD>

<TD>Attempt to determine the source position based on measured rope tensions.
This calculation is highly error-prone due to static friction and errors
in tension measurements, sowill not accurately determine the source position.
The results of the calculation are displayed, and the source position is
left unchanged. In an emergency, this command can be used in conjunction
with the LOCATE command to retrieve a lost source.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>PATTERN &lt;file> [time]</B></TD>

<TD>Move the source around a predefined pattern specified by the given
file. Time is the time in seconds that the manipulator will remain stationary
between pattern points. If no time is specified, the default of 120 seconds
is assumed. The pattern file is an ASCII file. The first line spcifies
the name of the output log file. Then subsequent lines specify X Y Z coordinates
of the patter points. A line containing the string "REPEAT" causes the
pattern to be repeated from the first point.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>TENSIONS [x y z]</B></TD>

<TD>Display expected tensions for the specified position, or for the current
position if none is specified. In the vessel, the central rope tension
must be known in order to calculate the side rope tensions. If no position
is specified, the current central rope tension is used. Otherwise the central
rope control tension (from AXIS.DAT) is used.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>LENGTHS [x y z]</B></TD>

<TD>Display the expeced rope lengths for the specified position, or for
the current position if none is specified.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>NETFORCE [x y z]</B></TD>

<TD>Display the net force for the specified location, or for the current
position if none is specified.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD WIDTH="150"><B>CONNECT [axis...]</B></TD>

<TD>Connect the polyaxis to one or more axes. (i.e. PROTOTYPE CONNECT EASTROPE
CENTRALROPE WESTROPE -- connects the prototype source to three axes) If
no axes are specified, the currently connected axes are displayed.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>DISCONNECT [axis...]</B></TD>

<TD>Disconnects axes from a polyaxis object. If no axis list is given,
then <U>all</U> axes are disconnected from the source.</TD>
</TR>

<TR VALIGN=TOP>
<TD><B>RESET</B></TD>

<TD>Executes the reset command for all currently connected axes. The reset
command resets the <A HREF="manip_calc.html#AxisError">encoder errors</A>,
and should only be necessary in the event of motor, encoder or loadcell
failure.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><B>MOTION [strategy]</B></TD>

<TD>Sets or displays motion strategy for moves in the vessel. Strategy
is one of DIRECT, ORTHO or UMBIL. If no strategy is given, the current
state is displayed. If motion is set to DIRECT, the manipulator will move
the source directly between the two points. ORTHO mode moves in horizontal
and vertical lines to reach the destination. See the
<a href="../figures/manip_ortho.html">ORTHO motion figure</a> for a visual
representation of this motion type.  This mode is useful because
it avoids high and low tension areas when moving between points near the
edges of the vessel. UMBIL motion causes the source to move in paths of
constant umbilical length when the umbilical is rubbing on the neck ring.
The source is moved to the center line of the vessel in order to change
the umbilical length. For DIRECT moves, every move within the vessel is
accomplished in one segment. Moves between the vessel and the neck are
always broken up into two segments, with an intermediate point just below
the neck ring. In ORTHO mode, vessel moves can be broken two segments,
and in UMBIL mode, up to three segments. Use of ORTHO mode is suggested
for 3-axis control.</TD>
</TR>

<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><B>EQUALIZE [ON|OFF]</B></TD>

<TD>Turns on or off tension equalization mode, or displays the current
state if no parameters are given. With tension equalization on, the side
ropes are set to their calculated tensions after the source comes to rest.
This may prevent unwanted motion of the source due to relaxing of the springs
when the source is supposed to be stationary. It is suggested that this
mode be left OFF unless source motion problems are observed.</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD VALIGN=TOP><B>&lt;axis> &lt;cmd> [args...]</B></TD>

<TD>Executes Axis level commands via the PolyAxis object.  Allows
control of individual source ropes.  Additional logic is built in
if Axes are driven at this level.  This logic prevents an axis from being
driven at low or high tension, and prevents other PolyAxis ropes from going
into low or high tension while the Axis is driving.  If a rope is already
outside the tension range, then other Axes may be driven but only in a
direction which would restore the axis to an acceptable tension.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<P><A NAME="R_Source"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>R_Source
