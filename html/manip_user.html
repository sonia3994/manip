Overview</FONT></FONT></B>
<BR>
<BR>The manipulator software controls a set of motors which are used to
drive the ropes attached to the manipulator source positioning system.
The program runs on Mac/Linux, and can be controlled from the local
console or a remote computer. Any authorized remote computer may issue
commands by connecting to port 2000 of the manipulator PC with a standard
telnet style connection.

<P>There are a total of 8 <B><A HREF="MotorMount.JPG">motor mounts</A></B>
which the manipulator PC can drive. Each one has a motor to drive the
rope, and encoder to measure the rope position, and a loadcell to measure
the rope tension. The maximum number of ropes that can be connected
simultaneously is three -- one central rope and two side ropes (plus one
umbilical). This allows the source to be moved in one of two planes depending on
whether the east/west or north/south side ropes are attached.

<P>The manipulator software also controls the <B>umbilical drive units</B>
and the nitrogen laser, and monitors the acrylic vessel position through
7 sense ropes.

<P><A NAME="SoftwareOverview"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Software
Overview</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The manipulator software is <B>object based</B>, and operates with a
simple <B>command line interface</B>. Objects respond to a set of <A HREF="manip_cmd.html">commands</A>
which allow control and monitoring of the various manipulator components.
Most interaction will be with the higher level objects which control the
manipulator motion with the highest intelligence and greatest number of
built-in safeguards.

<P>The primary object type for controlling the manipulator position is
the <B>PolyAxis</B> class. Each physical source has a corresponding PolyAxis
object in the software. For a detailed explanation of the object hierarchy,
see the <A HREF="manip_code.html">source code documentation</A>.

<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="100%">

<P><A NAME="SupportFiles"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Support
Files</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>When the program starts up, it reads all of the initialization parameters
from <B>.DAT files</B> from the current directory. These files contain
information about the hardware setup as well as the current operating parameters
and source position.

<P>A geometry test is done at startup if the file <B>TESTGEOM.IN</B> is
found. A set of position calculations is performed on data from the file
and the results are compared to calculations for the current PolyAxis object.
The differences are displayed for each point stored in the file. The file
TESTGEOM.IN simply contains the output of the PolyAxis MONITOR command
for a number of points in the vessel. The purpose of this check is to
catch discrepancies in the geometry parameters of the data files.

<P>The <B><A HREF="manip_cmd.html#CmdFile">command files</A></B> contain
lists of commands to perform in a batch. The command files may have any
name, but always end in a .CMD extension. These files are used to execute
commonly used groups of commands.

<P>
<HR SIZE=4 WIDTH="100%">

<P><A NAME="SourcePosition"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Source
Position Control</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>Before a source can be moved in the detector, its position must first
be <A HREF="manip_proc.html#CalibratingPosition">calibrated</A>. Once
this is done, the source can <B>driven to any point</B> in the detector
using the absolute TO command, or the relative BY command (see the <A HREF="manip_cmd.html#PolyAxis">PolyAxis
command list</A> for a complete description of these and other PolyAxis
commands). These commands will not let you move the source to any point
where it would come in contact with the vessel or leave any of the ropes
with a tension that is outside the working tension range (specified separately
for each rope in the file <A HREF="manip_dat.html#AXIS.DAT">AXIS.DAT</A>).

<P>Depending on the geometry of the ropes attached to the source, <B>certain
coordinates are ignored</B> when entering moving the source. For example,
with a single-axis system you could specify the source move to 0 0 500
even though the actual X-Y coordinates of the feedthrough are not 0 0.
In this case, the X-Y coordinates entered are ignored, and the source is
driven to the proper Z coordinate. Similarly, a source with the east/west
side ropes attached can only move in the X-Z plane, so the entered Y coordinate
is ignored.

<P>

<P><A NAME="PositionAccuracy"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Position
Accuracy</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>With three ropes attached to the manipulator, the source can be moved
in a plane. In this configuration the manipulator position accuracy is
about 3 cm inside the acrylic vessel body. However, the accuracy varies
with position inside the vessel and can be as good as 1 cm in some areas.
The accuracy in the vessel neck is much worse, with up to 15 cm of error
at times. With only one rope attached, the source can be moved in a vertical
line. In this configuration, the position accuracy is about 2 cm.

<P>The manipulator position accuracy depends heavily on the surveyed accuracy
of the rope attachment points and acrylic vessel neck ring. Errors in
the surveyed position of the AV attachment blocks and neck ring translate
into manipulator position errors of roughly the same magnitude. Accuracy
in the surveyed position of the top feedthroughs has a diminished effect
on the 3-rope manipulator system, but is crutial for the 1-rope manipulator.

<P><A NAME="TimeSynchronization"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Time
Synchronization</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The manipulator PC clock must be synchronized with the SNO time server
before starting the MANIP program.&nbsp; This allows accurate timestamps
to be generated for the data inserted into the event stream.&nbsp; The
timestamps also contain information about the time zone (which is assumed
to be GMT-5 because this software is designed to run only in Sudbury) and
the state of daylight savings time.&nbsp; The daylight savings time status
is taken from the TZ environment variable.&nbsp; (i.e. from DOS, "SET TZ=EST5EDT"
for daylight savings time, and "SET TZ=EST5" for standard time.)

<P><A NAME="SafetyShutoffs"></A><B><FONT COLOR="#800000"><FONT SIZE=+1>Safety
Shutoffs</FONT></FONT></B>

<P>The motion of the manipulator will be halted immediately if any one
of a number of situations arises. Note that these safety features are
implemented by the PolyAxis class only if the source is driven through
a PolyAxis command <U>or</U> if the ropes are being driven directly and
one or more of the PolyAxis ropes is in tension mode. These features can
be overridden by setting <A HREF="manip_cmd.html#PolyAxis">ERRORSTOP</A>
off, but this should hopefully never be necessary.

<P>The <B>tension error shutoff</B> will stop the manipulator motion if
any of the rope tensions either drops below its minimum, or goes above
its maximum value. Should the need arise, follow the procedures for <A HREF="manip_proc.html#RecoveringAxisError">recovering
from a tension error</A>.

<P>The <B>axis error shutoff</B> will stop the motion if any of the encoders
disagree with the motor position outside a certain tolerance. There are
also procedures established for <A HREF="manip_proc.html#RecoveringAxisError">recovering
from an axis error</A>.

<P>The <B>calculation error shutoff </B>stops the motion if there is a
problem with the calculations. This may happen if the solution is inconsistent
because of an unusually large error in one or more of the rope lengths.
To fix this situation, a <A HREF="manip_proc.html#CalibratingPosition">calibration</A>
of the source position should be done.

<P>The <B>net force shutoff</B> will stop the manipulator if the net force
on the source is outside a certain range. The net force is calculated
as the sum total of all forces including gravity, buoyancy and forces due
to all ropes. This net force should be zero, and if it exceeds a certain
limit it is an indication that some outside force is acting on the source,
which could mean that a rope has become tangled or the source has come
in contact with something in the vessel. There are no established procedures
from recovering from this situation. Use your head if this ever arises,
but it should be a very uncommon occurrence.  <FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><B>Note:</B> This shutoff has been
disabled in the current version of the software.</FONT>

<P>The <B>stuck stop</B> stops the source near an endpoint to prevent futile
hunting for a position that is unattainable. This can happen because the
manipulator software attempts to drive the ropes to within one encoder
step of the desired length, but in practice this goal may be unrealistic
because of the effects of static friction combined with the springs on
the ropes. If the motors reverse more than four times while trying to
reach a particular rope length, a "stuck stop" is issued, and the manipulator
motion is halted. In this case, the source is very near the endpoint and
the reported position is accurate, so no action should be necessary.

<P>The <B>axis flag shutoff</B> stops motion if a critical axis flag bit
has been set.  The axis flags can be wired to limit switches or tension
switches to prevent certain failure modes.  The axis flags are described
in more detail in the section on <a href="manip_dat.html#AXIS.DAT">AXIS.DAT</a>.

<P>The <B>axis alarm shutoff</B> stops motion if a rope has exceeded a
preset maximum tension at any time in its history.  To resume use of the
manipulator after an axis alarm, the axis ALARMRESET command must be used.
See the section on <a href="manip_cmd.html#Axis">axis commands</a> for more details.
