<H1>Calibration Source Location</H1>

</h4>
<h4>Updated 2 August 1999</h4>
This note describes the current information available on positioning
the calibration source.  While the general information will not change,
the user should be cautious about specific numbers used.

<h3>Coordinate System</h3>
  The manipulator positions sources in the detector relative
to a ficticious <b>global coordinate system</b> which is defined
as centred on the position that the engineering drawings intended the
centre of the Acrylic Vessel to hang.  The axes of this coordinate system
are oriented the same as detector coordinates:  Z in up. Y is 
"construction north", i.e towards the pipes in the AV chimney.  X is towards
the control room door.

<p>
  In fact the AV is currently hanging about 4 cm below the global coordinate
system origin.  The AV position in global coordinates is measured using
<b>neck monitors</b> and should be recorded in the data stream.  It 
only changed during water fill and is now very stable.
  
<p>
  The relative position of the global coordinate system and the
PSUP is inferred from measurements made by Davis Earle.  These
measurements will be incorporated later.

<h3>Pivot - Centre Offset</h3>
<p>
The part of the calibration source manipulator lowered into the detector
consists of a carriage and weight assembly below which is attached the
calibration source (see figure).

The manipulator system uses the pivot of the manipulator carriage (the
point that the ropes are attached to)
to
position a source in the detector.  The pivot is used because the distance
from the pivot to the centre of the source depends on which source is
used.  When doing calibration runs with the source, the detector operator
should record in the log book the <b>pivot position</b>.  Sometimes the
operator also records the location of the centre of the source.  However,
anybody analyzing data from the sources should be sure that the operator
recorded the correct position for the centre of the source (there have
been several instances of using  the wrong value for the <b>pivot-centre</b>
distance).  <b>The pivot location is the best information available on
the position of a source</b>.
</p>
  

<p>
Below are the current best numbers for the distance from the
manipulator pivot to the centre of the calibration sources.
Various changes in the hardware could result in these numbers
changing so varify them before using.

<h3>Positioning accuracy</h3>

<p>
  There are several issues regarding the accuracy with which the source
is positioned.  The certainty with which we locate the source depends
on the mode of deployment.  The source can be deployed in either
<b>single axis mode</b> or in <b>three axis mode</b>.
</p>
<p>
  While it is not usually recorded in the log book what the mode
of deployment for the source is, one can usually infer it from the
position.  In single axis mode, the source moves along a line directly
below the gatevalve through which it is deployed.  For three axis
deployment, the source moves along either the xz or yz plane.  If
one is looking at the calibration banks in the data stream, single axis
deployment will only have two axes attached (the central rope and
umbilical).  Three axis deployment will have four axes attached
(central rope, umbilical and two side ropes).


<h4>Single Axis Deployment</h4>
<p>
  In <b>Single Axis Mode</b> the source is lowered straight down into 
the detector on a <b>central rope</b> and <b>umbilical</b> attached to
the <b>Umbilical Retrevial Mechanism</b> (URM).  Gravity determines that
the source always hangs directly below the URM which is centred on a
gate valve attached to the glovebox (this is not exactly true, see
below).  The horizontal position of the
source is thus determined by the position of the gate valve on the
glovebox.  The position of the gate valves were determined from the
engineering drawings.  The horizontal alignment of the glovebox and
gate valve has only been roughly confirmed at the few cm level but
there are no indications of a gross misalignment.

<tr><td>Valve<td>size<td> X(cm) <td> Y(cm)
<tr><td>1    <td>10 inch <td>   0.000 <td> -21.590 
<tr><td>2    <td> 6 inch <td>  16.906 <td>  23.495
<tr><td>3    <td> 4 inch <td> -16.035 <td>  23.495
</table>
</center>
Since January, the sources have been deployed through gatevalve
3 on the glovebox.  This is the 4 inch gate valve located at 
+y and -x (north west).
</p>
 
<p>
  The vertical position of the source is determined by measuring
the length of rope deployed from the URM.  The positioning accuracy
has been determined by attaching a footswitch to the manipulator
and touching the bottom of the AV.  The measured position is consistant
with independent measurements and drawings to the order of 2cm and
is reproducable to the order of 1 cm.  
</p>
  
<p>
  It was noted that the statement that the source hangs directly
below the gate valve is not quite true.  This is because most of
the weight of the source is supported by the central rope which
is attached off centre by approximately 1 cm.  This means that
a source hangs at a slight angle if it is in single axis mode.
The amount of the displacement has not been measured but it is on
the order of 1 to 2 cm at most for the laserball and N16 sources.
It should also be noted that this offset is not present when the
source is supported in three axis mode because the side ropes take
most of the load in a symmetric fashion.

<h4>Three Axis Deployment</h4>
<p>
  <b>Three axis deployment</b> is when the side ropes are connected
to the source.  This then allows the source to be positioned in either
the XZ plane (if the east and west side ropes are attached) or in
the YZ plane (if the north and south side ropes are attached).  The source
does not move in exactly the XZ or YZ plane.  This is because the
URM and side ropes do not all lie in a plane.  However, the deviation
from the XZ or YZ plane is small, usually no more than 2 cm and the
actual position is measured and recorded.
</p>
<p>
  The positioning accuracy of the manipulator in three axis mode
is still under investigation.  Measurements of the positioning
accuracy at the bottom of the AV within +/- 2.5 m of the central
axis indicate an absolute positioning accuracy of better than 2cm.
The accuracy is expected to be at least this good along the central
axis with the acception of points near the top of the AV.
</p>
<p>
  For points along the central axis above z=570cm, the manipulator
positioning alogrithms have problems and points may not be accurate
to better than 10cm.
</p>
<p>
  For points far off the central axis 
(far means 2m or more away in the top half of the AV)
we have not yet determined the
positioning accuracy.  However, constraints on the rope lengths are
expected to give an accuracy better than 10 cm.
</p>

<h4>Controversy with positioning</h4>
Having said how well we can position a source, there is a controversy.
Specifically, laserball analysis by Bill Frati shows what appears to
be a 15cm shift  in the source position after it is first moved to
a location in the detector.  The data
show an apparent movement of the source over 20 to 30 seconds with it
coming to rest at a point different from its intended position.  These
conclusions are still under investigation but for now the user should
be cautious of the source position.
